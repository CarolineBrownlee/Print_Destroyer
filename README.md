What is Print Destroyer?

Jim Madison is a local business owner and screen print artist in Bowling Green, Kentucky. He came to me with a desire to build his own marketplace at his fingertips for his company, Print Destroyer. Jim wants his customers to be able to create an account, see Jim's inventory of prints, and save favorites to a wishlist. (Version two of this application will have cart and purchasing capabilities, as well as allow customers to contact each other to buy, sell, and trade Jim's screen prints. 

Customers:

Upon registration, users will be able to build their own profile with a photo, bio, and contact information. 
Upon login, users will be able to access an inventory of Jim's work with details, cost, title, and a photo of each screen print. The user will be able to save favorite screen prints to a wishlist. Users will be able to remove screen prints from their wishlist. Users will be able to edit their profile. Users will be able to logout when exiting the app, which will take them back to the homepage. 

Administrator:

As the administator of his own site, Jim will be able to add new screen prints to his inventory by uploading a photo, title, details, and cost to his database for each print. Jim will be able to edit information for each print in his inventory, or delete them from his database. Jim will be able to access his customer profiles and delete them from his database. 

This application is built using the React library and JSON Server.
